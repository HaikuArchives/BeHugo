The version of MikMod used for development is 3.1.9.  It looks
like they've incorporated my fixes for the previous version, so
the only change I've made to the source is:

mdreg.c:
- comment out
	_mm_registerdriver(&drv_raw);
	_mm_registerdriver(&drv_wav);

  to avoid writing giant .raw files if no other sound device
  is available
